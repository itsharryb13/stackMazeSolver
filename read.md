This piece of code in Java demonstrates a maze-solving algorithm using a stack. 

1. **Constants:** 
    - PATH, WALL, and VISITED are predefined constants representing different states in the maze.

2. **Inner Class (Point):**
    - Represents a specific point in the maze with x and y coordinates.

3. **solveMaze Method:**
    - Accepts a maze represented by a 2D array of integers (maze), as well as the starting and ending coordinates (startX, startY, endX, endY).
    - Employs a Stack<Point> to execute depth-first search.
    - Repeatedly iterates through the stack until it is empty:
        - Removes the current point from the stack.
        - Verifies if the move is valid using the isValidMove function.
        - If the move is valid, marks the current position as visited and checks if it is the exit.
        - If the exit is reached, outputs Maze solved! and the final state of the maze utilizing the printMaze function.
        - Otherwise, appends adjacent positions to the stack using pushAdjacentPositions.
    - If the stack becomes empty, prints No solution found.

4. **Helper Methods:**
    - isValidMove: Determines if a move is valid, ensuring it remains within the maze boundaries, avoids walls, and has not been previously visited.
    - isOutOfBounds: Assesses whether a point is outside the maze's boundaries.
    - isWall: Determines if a point represents a wall.
    - isVisited: Checks if a point has been visited.
    - markVisited: Indicates that a point has been visited.
    - isExit: Determines if a point corresponds to the exit.
    - pushAdjacentPositions: Adds adjacent positions to the stack.
    - printMaze: Prints the current state of the maze.

5. **main Method:**
    - Creates a maze utilizing a 2D array.
    - Specifies the starting and ending coordinates.
    - Invokes the solveMaze function with the maze and coordinates to test the maze solver.

6. **Maze Representation:**
    - The maze is represented as a 2D array of integers, where 0 denotes a path, 1 represents a wall, and 2 signifies a visited cell.
